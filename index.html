              As a pack-in with Nintendo's GameBoy, Tetris helped establish the
              portable gaming console as one of the best selling ever.

          You see yourself staring down a familiar sight. The trappings, boxes,
          sounds, and sights of days gone by glitter around you like gemstones
          in a river. <br /><br />

          Digging in a box one day, you find a forgotten copy of Tetris for
          GameBoy, dusty but carefully preserved. You wipe at it with your
          fingers, and give it a sharp dusting with a breath. Looking at the
          faded picture of those shapes falling from a vanishing point above
          brings back a flood of memories. <br /><br />

          Nights crouched near a lamp or with a flashlight in your teeth. Road
          trips with your face pressed against the window, trying to get that
          perfect sunbeam angle. Summers of your mom or dad telling you to put
          it down and go outside, but you're positive you can beat your high
          score this time...<br /><br />
          Now you start pawing around in the box some more, wondering what other
          treasure might be inside. Maybe the GameBoy itself is somewhere in
          there. Would it even still work? Maybe you could fix it? Maybe you can
          find another...
          <br /><br />
          Maybe that's how it began for you. And before you know it, you're a
          retro gamer. A collector.

          “The whole point of collecting is the thrill of acquisition, which
          must be maximized, and maintained at all costs.” <br />― John Baxter,
          A Pound of Paper: Confessions of a Book Addict
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          While the quote above may be true to most collecting, collecting retro
          gaming goods holds far wider range in its satisfactions. Undoubted,
          there is still that "thrill of acquisition" in finding that one copy
          of Mega Man 6 to complete your collection in a bargin bin at a thrift
          store. But the difference between collecting games and other passtimes
          involving the accumlation of stuff is once you obtain it, you can
          interact with it. <br /><br />
          Yes, you can put it in plastic or glass or boxes and store it, but
          some of the real joy of gaming is pulling out an original copy of
          Chrono Trigger, powering on a CRT with its iconic debossing twang,
          firing it up a SNES, and reliving the golden days of youth in 1996. Or
          1986. Or 1976.
          <br /><br />
          Or maybe play it in a whole new way you never knew about.
