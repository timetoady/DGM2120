        <h1>Collect</h1>
        <!-- This section will be made much nicer with div and section tags -->
        <p>
          Starting a collection is a little like throwing a grenade: once the
          pin is pulled and the spoon flips, you got to get things moving in a
          direction so it doesn't all blow up in your face. Here are just a few
          things to keep in mind as you get started.
        </p>

        <h2>Pick your Potion</h2>

        <p>
          For most of us, there is no cheat code to give infinite money.
          Certainly none for infinite space, either, or max patience on the part
          of your spouce or significant other. So if you're thinking of getting
          into collecting retro gaming related items, it's best if you start by
          finding your passion. Instead of collecting <em>every</em> NES title,
          maybe do all your favorites from childhood, or the top 50 online. Pick
          a system, or a genre, or an console generation that appeals to you. Or
          you could start with instruction manuals. I wouldn't judge.
          <br /><br />For me, my personal focus is controllers. To me, few
          things speak to the artistry, identity, and feel of a gaming system
          than how you inter act with it . Here is a
          <a href="gallery.html">gallery</a> of some of my favorites.
        </p>

        <h2>Where to Look</h2>

        <p>
          There's a lot of people on the internet. Most of them will gladly bilk
          you of your shillings given half a chance. So as a rule of thumb, the
          closer they are to you, the less likely they want to reach quite as
          deeply into you pocket. Below is a list of the best sources for
          gaining those coveted no-longer-in-production gems from yesteryear.
          All of these are viable sources, and all of them can turn on you like
          your brother in a foam noodle fight, but the ones at the top of the
          list are more likely to treat you fairly.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>People you know</li>
          <li>Garage sales</li>
          <li>Online community pages</li>
          <li>Thrift stores</li>
          <li>Auction sites</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          And when in doubt, <strong>verify</strong>. With price tracking sites
          like
          <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/" target="_blank"
            >Pricecharting.com</a
          >
          or
          <a href="https://gamevaluenow.com/" target="_blank"
            >GameValueNow.com</a
          >, or many others Google can guide you to, you can avoid your slick
          uncle Charles pulling a fast one on you with his one-of-a-kind,
          vintage, first-edition loose Duck Hunt cartrage.
        </p>

        <h2>Tracking</h2>

        <p>
          Once your precious collection starts rolling, in addition to how you
          display it, you might want to start thinking of how you are going to
          keep track of it. The main difference between a collection and trash
          heap is organization, and you really don't want to be the next subject
          of a <em>Horders</em> episode, and bring shame on your family name for
          generations.<br />
          <br />
          And believe me: it can get rolling in a <em>hurry</em>. So best find a
          way to sort 'em soon.<br />

            Welcome to the wild world of modern information tracking. Weather
            you are a wily veteran of Excel or cruise on the free wings of
            Google Sheets, you've probably at least dealt with spreadsheeting
            before. While not always flashy, a little savvy here can help you
            keep your stuff organized your way.

            You always have your phone, and if you don't, you're a shame and an
            outcast in modern society.<br />
            The good thing about always packing a portable phone of the smart
            variety are the apps that make your life easier, and there are
            plenty to be had that want to help you keep your loot organized.

            Sometimes, you just want a nice, hard-copy list of your h̶o̶a̶r̶d̶
            collection. It's nice to stroll up to the TV, thumb through a few
            pages, tab what you are feeling right now, and pull it out.
            Especially if you don't have the space to display every one.
